# Conway's game of life in JavaScript

I've written Conway's GOL in Python in the past. I thought I'd try a quick version in JavaScript that runs in the browser.

As with many things in the programming world, there are probably better implementations out there, so, feel free to take the parts you like and leave the parts you don't :)
