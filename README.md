# Conway's game of life in JavaScript

I've written Conway's GOL in Python in the past. I thought I'd try a quick version in JavaScript that runs in the browser.

As with many things in the programming world, there are probably better implementations out there, so, feel free to take the parts you like and leave the parts you don't :)

To change the grid size, adjust the constants GRID_HEIGHT and GRID_WIDTH.

To change the update frequency, adjust the constant ANIMATION_DELAY_IN_MS.

To change the patterns present at the start, alter the list of add*() functions that are called to load the startup patterns. Optionally, define your own!
